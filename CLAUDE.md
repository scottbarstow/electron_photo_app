# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Structure

This is a minimal repository focused on Claude Code custom commands:

- `.claude/commands/` - Contains custom Claude Code command definitions
  - `create_issue.md` - Comprehensive GitHub issue creation command with multiple detail levels

## Custom Commands

### GitHub Issue Creation

The repository includes a sophisticated issue creation command (`create_issue.md`) that provides:

- **Three detail levels**: MINIMAL, MORE (Standard), and A LOT (Comprehensive)
- **Research integration**: Uses Context7 MCP and web search for best practices
- **Template-driven approach**: Structured formats for different issue types
- **AI-era considerations**: Accounts for AI-assisted development workflows

**Usage**: Reference this command when users need help creating well-structured GitHub issues that follow project conventions.

## Development Workflow

This repository appears to be a command library rather than a traditional development project. When working here:

- Focus on command documentation and structure
- Maintain the existing markdown format for commands
- Follow the detailed template structure shown in `create_issue.md`
- Consider research integration patterns when creating new commands

## Architecture Notes

The command structure follows a comprehensive template approach:
- Prerequisites and setup requirements
- Multi-phase research and planning sections
- Flexible detail levels to match user needs
- Integration with external tools (GitHub CLI, Context7 MCP)
- Modern development considerations including AI tool usage
