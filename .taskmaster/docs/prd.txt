# Photo Management App - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview

**Product Name**: Photo Management App
**Platform**: Desktop (Electron-based)
**Target OS**: macOS and Windows
**Architecture**: Electron + React + Node.js + SQLite

## Product Vision

Build a desktop application that helps users organize their photo collections by providing an intuitive interface to browse directories, preview images, and automatically detect and manage duplicate photos.

## Core Features

### 1. Root Directory Selection
**Description**: Allow users to select and persist a root directory for photo management
**Requirements**:
- File dialog interface using electron.dialog
- Persistent storage of selected path in local storage
- Validation of directory access permissions
- Support for changing root directory

### 2. Folder Navigation System
**Description**: Hierarchical folder browsing with tree view interface
**Requirements**:
- Tree view component for folder navigation (consider react-sortable-tree)
- File system integration using Node.js fs module
- Real-time directory structure updates
- Support for nested folder structures
- Fast directory traversal and caching

### 3. Photo Preview System
**Description**: Image viewing with zoom and navigation capabilities
**Requirements**:
- Image viewer component with zoom in/out functionality
- Support for common image formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF, TIFF, WebP)
- Keyboard navigation between images
- Image metadata display (file size, dimensions, creation date)
- Responsive image loading and display

### 4. Duplicate Photo Detection
**Description**: Automated duplicate detection using file hashing
**Requirements**:
- File hashing implementation using crypto module
- SQLite database for storing image hashes and metadata
- Batch processing for large photo collections
- Progress indicators during scanning
- Configurable similarity thresholds
- Support for different hash algorithms

### 5. Duplicate Management Interface
**Description**: User interface for reviewing and managing duplicate photos
**Requirements**:
- List view displaying duplicate groups
- Side-by-side comparison of duplicates
- Batch selection and deletion capabilities
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Undo functionality for accidental deletions
- File information display (path, size, date)

## Technical Requirements

### Performance Specifications
- Lazy loading for image thumbnails and previews
- Batch processing for file operations to prevent UI blocking
- Efficient memory management for large image collections
- Database indexing for fast duplicate lookups
- Asynchronous file operations

### Security Requirements
- Proper file access permission management
- Input validation and sanitization for all user inputs
- Secure handling of file system operations
- Protection against directory traversal attacks
- Safe handling of corrupted or malicious image files

### Database Schema
- Image metadata table (path, hash, size, date, dimensions)
- Duplicate groups table for organizing related duplicates
- User preferences table for app settings
- Directory index table for navigation optimization

## User Experience Requirements

### Interface Design
- Clean, intuitive desktop application interface
- Responsive layout that works on different screen sizes
- Keyboard shortcuts for common operations
- Progress indicators for long-running operations
- Contextual menus and toolbar actions

### Workflow Design
- Simple onboarding process for first-time users
- Clear visual feedback for all user actions
- Non-destructive operations by default
- Easy navigation between different app sections

## Testing Strategy
